Tibian
======

Project 'tibian', also known as the 'TIcket Birthday Announcer',
is a project to announce tickets that it's birthday today.
That means it announces ticket titles and summaries that were created a few
years ago and are still open to a number of channels that you specified before.
For example, the Jira tickets of a project can be published to a Teams channel
regularly and make some people happy (or angry).

Right now, the project is in a very early stage and it's not fully functional.


Usage
-----

To use this project, you need to create a configuration file in the same directory.
To start, copy the `config.example.yaml` file to `config.yaml` and edit it.
The name is important here, because it's used to identify the configuration file.
For details about configuration, visit section `Configuration`.

To install the project, run one of the following command::

    poetry install # or
    pip install tibian

Later one is preferred, as it installs the project with the same versions
as we tested before release and in a virtual environment.

Afterwards, you can start the project by running the `tibian` command::

    tibian

Afterwards, it should announce the birthdays of tickets of the current date
as specified.

Configuration
-------------

The configuration file for the project must be located in the root folder
of the execution command. A short (any maybe not complete) description of
the configuration file is given in `config.example.yaml` on GitHub.

Copy this output to a file `config.yaml` in the current directory, add your credentials
and remove parts you don't need.

Detailed information about all config options will be given soon,
but for this version most of the configuration should be self-explanatory.

'type' is the type of source or target you have,
'name' is an internal used name for the source/target, and
'config' is a type-dependant dictionary of types as shown.


Versioning
-----------

We use `semantic versioning`_ to version the project. As we are in some sort of 'beta',
we may (but try not to) do some breaking changes between minor versions to fix some obvious
misbehavior of the project. For example, we may change the configuration file format or
add new options to the configuration file. As we try to prevent this and add a backlog how to
upgrade to newer versions, you maybe want to check the changelog before updating to new versions.


Development
-----------

We are always happy about active support. If you want to actively develop on tibian, follow the next few commands.
We use poetry_ for the development of tibian. You can install it with the following command::

    pip install poetry

To install all development dependencies, run::

    poetry install --with dev

Afterwards, you have all dependencies (including dev dependencies) installed in a virtualenv, and are able to develop.

To add new dependencies, run::

    poetry add <package>

To activate your virtualenv, run::

    poetry shell

Afterwards, you can run all following commands in the virtualenv. In case you don't, you have to add 'poetry run' before each
of the next commands to execute it in the virtualenv, or you will get missing requirements errors.

Additionally, we use `pre-commit`_ as our tool to enforce some styling and lint rules. To install pre-commit, run::

    pre-commit install

This will install all hooks and run them automatically on a commit. You can also run these rules manually by doing::

    pre-commit run --all

To run the tests and get some coverage information, run::

    ./scripts/run_tests.sh
